1. Setting Up Your Flask Application
First,create a new directory for your project and set up a virtual environment:
mkdir digital_library_app
cd digital_library_app
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
•	On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Flask and other necessary libraries:
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate Flask-Bcrypt Flask-JWT-Extended
2. Setting Up Your Flask Application Structure
Create the basic structure for your Flask app:
•	app.py: Main entry point for your application.
•	models.py: Define database models (e.g., Book model).
•	config.py: Configuration settings for your app.
•	routes/: Directory to store different route handlers.
•	migrations/: Directory to store database migrations.
3. Database Setup with SQLAlchemy
In models.py, define your database models using SQLAlchemy:
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Book(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    isbn = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=True, nullable=False)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    author = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    book_length = db.Column(db.Integer)
    hardcover = db.Column(db.Boolean)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Book {self.title}>'
4. Configuring Your Flask App
In app.py, set up your Flask application and configure SQLAlchemy:
from flask import Flask
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from config import Config
from models import db

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)
db.init_app(app)
bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
jwt = JWTManager(app)
migrate = Migrate(app, db)

from routes import auth, books
app.register_blueprint(auth.bp)
app.register_blueprint(books.bp)
5. Implementing Authentication Routes
Create auth.py inside the routes directory for handling user authentication (login, logout, register) using Flask-JWT-Extended for token-based authentication.
6. Implementing CRUD API Routes for Books
Create books.py inside the routes directory for CRUD operations on books:
•	GET /books - Retrieve all books.
•	GET /books/<book_id> - Retrieve a specific book by ID.
•	POST /books - Add a new book.
•	PUT /books/<book_id> - Update a book.
•	DELETE /books/<book_id> - Delete a book.
7. Testing Your API
Use Insomnia or any REST API client to test your API endpoints. Make sure:
•	Authentication endpoints work correctly (login to get JWT token).
•	CRUD operations for books are functioning as expected.
8. Database Migration
Whenever you make changes to your database models, generate and apply migrations:
flask db migrate -m "Description of migration"flask db upgrade
9. Deployment Considerations
Consider how you will deploy your Flask application in the future. Tools like Docker and services like Heroku or AWS can simplify deployment.
Next Steps
•	Once your API routes are working, you can proceed to develop a front-end application to interact with your API.
•	Implement error handling, input validation, and logging to enhance the robustness of your application.
